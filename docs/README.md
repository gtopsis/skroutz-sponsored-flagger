## Why

The reason behind this extension, is to make right deliberately wrong by Skroutz.
Skroutz has decided to use a dark pattern in order to mislead consumers, in the pursuit of profits.

## How it Works

Once you install the extension, it will automatically detect and highlight all sponsored products in bright red color. This makes it easy for you to identify which products are sponsored and which ones are not. This way, you can make an informed decision about your purchases without being misled by Skroutz's dark pattern.

## Installation

To install the extension, simply download the source code from this repository and load it as an unpacked extension in Google Chrome. Once the extension is installed, it will automatically start highlighting all sponsored products on Skroutz.gr.
