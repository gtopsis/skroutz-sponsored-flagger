# Skroutz sponsored flagger

## Why

The reason behind this extension, is to make right, a deliberately wrong by Skroutz.
Skroutz has decided to use a dark pattern in order to mislead consumers, in the pursuit of profits.

## How it Works

This makes it easy for you to identify which products are sponsored and which ones are not. This way, you can make an informed decision about your purchases without being misled by Skroutz's dark pattern.
